/* Reverse words

Complete the function that accepts a string parameter, and reverses each word in the string. All spaces in the string should be retained.

Examples
"This is an example!" ==> "sihT si na !elpmaxe"
"double  spaces"      ==> "elbuod  secaps" */

function reverseWords(str) {
    // Go for it
    
    return str.split("").reverse().join("").split(" ").reverse().join(" ")
  }

/* Sum of the first nth term of Series

Task:
Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of following series upto nth term(parameter).

Series: 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 + 1/16 +...
Rules:
You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.

If the given value is 0 then it should return 0.00

You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.

Examples:(Input --> Output)
1 --> 1 --> "1.00"
2 --> 1 + 1/4 --> "1.25"
5 --> 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 --> "1.57" */

function SeriesSum(n)
{
  // Happy Coding ^_^
  
  for (var s = 0, i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    s += 1 / (1 + i * 3)
  }

  return s.toFixed(2)
}

/* Remove the minimum

The museum of incredible dull things
The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

However, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.

Task
Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

Don't change the order of the elements that are left.

Examples
* Input: [1,2,3,4,5], output = [2,3,4,5]
* Input: [5,3,2,1,4], output = [5,3,2,4]
* Input: [2,2,1,2,1], output = [2,2,2,1] */

function removeSmallest(numbers) {
  let min = numbers.indexOf(Math.min(...numbers))
