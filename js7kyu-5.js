/* Sum of the first nth term of Series

Task:
Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of following series upto nth term(parameter).

Series: 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 + 1/16 +...
Rules:
You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.

If the given value is 0 then it should return 0.00

You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.

Examples:(Input --> Output)
1 --> 1 --> "1.00"
2 --> 1 + 1/4 --> "1.25"
5 --> 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 --> "1.57" */

/* Remove the minimum

The museum of incredible dull things
The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

However, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.

Task
Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

Don't change the order of the elements that are left.

Examples
* Input: [1,2,3,4,5], output = [2,3,4,5]
* Input: [5,3,2,1,4], output = [5,3,2,4]
* Input: [2,2,1,2,1], output = [2,2,2,1] */

/* Don't give me five!

Don't give me five!
In this kata you get the start number and the end number of a region and should return the count of all numbers except numbers with a 5 in it. The start and the end number are both inclusive!

Examples:

1,9 -> 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -> Result 8
4,17 -> 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -> Result 12
The result may contain fives. ;-)
The start number will always be smaller than the end number. Both numbers can be also negative!

I'm very curious for your solutions and the way you solve it. Maybe someone of you will find an easy pure mathematics solution.

Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)

I have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata! */

/* The highest profit wins!

Story
Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again. Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy and sell it at the same price. Instead, he's going to buy it for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.

Task
Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.

Examples (Input --> Output)
[1,2,3,4,5] --> [1,5]
[2334454,5] --> [5,2334454]
[1]         --> [1,1]
Remarks
All arrays or lists will always have at least one element, so you don't need to check the length. Also, your function will always get an array or a list, you don't have to check for null, undefined or similar. */

You are given an odd-length array of integers, in which all of them are the same, except for one single number.

/* Money, Money, Money

Mr. Scrooge has a sum of money 'P' that he wants to invest. Before he does, he wants to know how many years 'Y' this sum 'P' has to be kept in the bank in order for it to amount to a desired sum of money 'D'.

The sum is kept for 'Y' years in the bank where interest 'I' is paid yearly. After paying taxes 'T' for the year the new sum is re-invested.

Note to Tax: not the invested principal is taxed, but only the year's accrued interest

Example:

  Let P be the Principal = 1000.00      
  Let I be the Interest Rate = 0.05      
  Let T be the Tax Rate = 0.18      
  Let D be the Desired Sum = 1100.00


After 1st Year -->
  P = 1041.00
After 2nd Year -->
  P = 1083.86
After 3rd Year -->
  P = 1128.30
Thus Mr. Scrooge has to wait for 3 years for the initial principal to amount to the desired sum.

Your task is to complete the method provided and return the number of years 'Y' as a whole in order for Mr. Scrooge to get the desired sum.

Assumption: Assume that Desired Principal 'D' is always greater than the initial principal. However it is best to take into consideration that if Desired Principal 'D' is equal to Principal 'P' this should return 0 Years. */

/* Breaking chocolate problem

Your task is to split the chocolate bar of given dimension n x m into small squares. Each square is of size 1x1 and unbreakable. Implement a function that will return minimum number of breaks needed.

For example if you are given a chocolate bar of size 2 x 1 you can split it to single squares in just one break, but for size 3 x 1 you must do two breaks.

If input data is invalid you should return 0 (as in no breaks are needed if we do not have any chocolate to split). Input will always be a non-negative integer. */

/* Count the Digit

Take an integer n (n >= 0) and a digit d (0 <= d <= 9) as an integer.

Square all numbers k (0 <= k <= n) between 0 and n.

Count the numbers of digits d used in the writing of all the k**2.

Call nb_dig (or nbDig or ...) the function taking n and d as parameters and returning this count.

Examples:
n = 10, d = 1 
the k*k are 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100
We are using the digit 1 in: 1, 16, 81, 100. The total count is then 4.

nb_dig(25, 1) returns 11 since
the k*k that contain the digit 1 are:
1, 16, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 361, 441.
So there are 11 digits 1 for the squares of numbers between 0 and 25.
Note that 121 has twice the digit 1. */

/* Sort array by string length

Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a sorted array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to longest.

For example, if this array were passed as an argument:

["Telescopes", "Glasses", "Eyes", "Monocles"]

Your function would return the following array:

["Eyes", "Glasses", "Monocles", "Telescopes"]

All of the strings in the array passed to your function will be different lengths, so you will not have to decide how to order multiple strings of the same length. */

/* Find the middle element

As a part of this Kata, you need to create a function that when provided with a triplet, returns the index of the numerical element that lies between the other two elements.

For example:

gimme([2, 3, 1]) => 0
2 is the number that fits between 1 and 3 and the index of 2 in the input array is 0.

Another example (just to make sure it is clear):

gimme([5, 10, 14]) => 1
10 is the number that fits between 5 and 14 and the index of 10 in the input array is  */

/* Sum of a sequence

Your task is to make function, which returns the sum of a sequence of integers.
