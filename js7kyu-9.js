/* Tidy Number (Special Numbers Series #9)

Definition
A Tidy number is a number whose digits are in non-decreasing order.

Task
Given a number, Find if it is Tidy or not .

Warm-up (Highly recommended)
Playing With Numbers Series
Notes
Number passed is always Positive .

Return the result as a Boolean

Input >> Output Examples
tidyNumber (12) ==> return (true)
Explanation:
The number's digits { 1 , 2 } are in non-Decreasing Order (i.e) 1 <= 2 .

tidyNumber (32) ==> return (false)
Explanation:
The Number's Digits { 3, 2} are not in non-Decreasing Order (i.e) 3 > 2 .

tidyNumber (1024) ==> return (false)
Explanation:
The Number's Digits {1 , 0, 2, 4} are not in non-Decreasing Order as 0 <= 1 .

tidyNumber (13579) ==> return (true)
Explanation:
The number's digits {1 , 3, 5, 7, 9} are in non-Decreasing Order .

tidyNumber (2335) ==> return (true)
Explanation:
The number's digits {2 , 3, 3, 5} are in non-Decreasing Order , Note 3 <= 3 */

function tidyNumber(n){
    //your code here
    const arr = n.toString().split("")
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
      if (arr[i] <= arr[i + 1]) {
        continue
      } else {
        return false
      }
    }
    return true
  }

/* Currying functions: multiply all elements in an array

To complete this Kata you need to make a function multiplyAll/multiply_all which takes an array of integers as an argument. This function must return another function, which takes a single integer as an argument and returns a new array.

The returned array should consist of each of the elements from the first array multiplied by the integer.

Example:

multiplyAll([1, 2, 3])(2) = [2, 4, 6];
You must not mutate the original array. */

function multiplyAll(arr) {
  return function(num) {
    return arr.map(v => v * num)
  }
}

/* Maximum Triplet Sum (Array Series #7)

Task
Given an array/list [] of n integers , find maximum triplet sum in the array Without duplications .

Notes :
Array/list size is at least 3 .

Array/list numbers could be a mixture of positives , negatives and zeros .

Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur , So (duplications are not included when summing).

Input >> Output Examples
1- maxTriSum ({3,2,6,8,2,3}) ==> return (17)
Explanation:
As the triplet that maximize the sum {6,8,3} in order , their sum is (17)

Note : duplications are not included when summing , (i.e) the numbers added only once .

2- maxTriSum ({2,1,8,0,6,4,8,6,2,4}) ==> return (18)
Explanation:
As the triplet that maximize the sum {8, 6, 4} in order , their sum is (18) ,

Note : duplications are not included when summing , (i.e) the numbers added only once .

3- maxTriSum ({-7,12,-7,29,-5,0,-7,0,0,29}) ==> return (41)
Explanation:
As the triplet that maximize the sum {12 , 29 , 0} in order , their sum is (41) ,

Note : duplications are not included when summing , (i.e) the numbers added only once . */

function maxTriSum(numbers){
  //your code here
  const sorted = [...new Set(numbers.sort((a, b) => b - a))]
  return sorted[0] + sorted[1] + sorted[2]
}

/* Alternate case

Write function alternateCase which switch every letter in string from upper to lower and from lower to upper. E.g: Hello World -> hELLO wORLD */

function alternateCase(s) {
  return s
    .split("")
    .map(value => {
      if (value != value.toUpperCase()) return value.toUpperCase()
      return value.toLowerCase()
    })
    .join("")
}

/* Sort Out The Men From Boys

Scenario
Now that the competition gets tough it will Sort out the men from the boys .

Men are the Even numbers and Boys are the odd!alt!alt
Task
Given an array/list [] of n integers , Separate The even numbers from the odds , or Separate the men from the boys!alt!alt
Notes
Return an array/list where Even numbers come first then odds

Since , Men are stronger than Boys , Then Even numbers in ascending order While odds in descending .

Array/list size is at least 4 .

Array/list numbers could be a mixture of positives , negatives .

Have no fear , It is guaranteed that no Zeroes will exists .!alt
Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur , So (duplications are not included when separating).

Input >> Output Examples:
menFromBoys ({7, 3 , 14 , 17}) ==> return ({14, 17, 7, 3}) 
Explanation:
Since , { 14 } is the even number here , So it came first , then the odds in descending order {17 , 7 , 3} .

menFromBoys ({-94, -99 , -100 , -99 , -96 , -99 }) ==> return ({-100 , -96 , -94 , -99})
Explanation:
Since , { -100, -96 , -94 } is the even numbers here , So it came first in *ascending order *, then the odds in descending order { -99 }

Since , (Duplications are not included when separating) , then you can see only one (-99) was appeared in the final array/list .

menFromBoys ({49 , 818 , -282 , 900 , 928 , 281 , -282 , -1 }) ==> return ({-282 , 818 , 900 , 928 , 281 , 49 , -1})
Explanation:
Since , {-282 , 818 , 900 , 928 } is the even numbers here , So it came first in ascending order , then the odds in descending order { 281 , 49 , -1 }

Since , (Duplications are not included when separating) , then you can see only one (-282) was appeared in the final array/list . */

function menFromBoys(arr){
  //your code here
  return [
    ...new Set(
      arr
        .filter(v => v % 2 === 0)
        .sort((a, b) => a - b)
        .concat(arr.filter(v => v % 2 !== 0).sort((a, b) => b - a))
