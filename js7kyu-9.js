Playing With Numbers Series
Notes
Number passed is always Positive .

Return the result as a Boolean

/* Currying functions: multiply all elements in an array

To complete this Kata you need to make a function multiplyAll/multiply_all which takes an array of integers as an argument. This function must return another function, which takes a single integer as an argument and returns a new array.

The returned array should consist of each of the elements from the first array multiplied by the integer.

Example:

multiplyAll([1, 2, 3])(2) = [2, 4, 6];
You must not mutate the original array. */

/* Maximum Triplet Sum (Array Series #7)

Task
Given an array/list [] of n integers , find maximum triplet sum in the array Without duplications .

Notes :
Array/list size is at least 3 .

Array/list numbers could be a mixture of positives , negatives and zeros .

Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur , So (duplications are not included when summing).

Input >> Output Examples
1- maxTriSum ({3,2,6,8,2,3}) ==> return (17)
Explanation:
As the triplet that maximize the sum {6,8,3} in order , their sum is (17)

Note : duplications are not included when summing , (i.e) the numbers added only once .

2- maxTriSum ({2,1,8,0,6,4,8,6,2,4}) ==> return (18)
Explanation:
As the triplet that maximize the sum {8, 6, 4} in order , their sum is (18) ,

Note : duplications are not included when summing , (i.e) the numbers added only once .

3- maxTriSum ({-7,12,-7,29,-5,0,-7,0,0,29}) ==> return (41)
Explanation:
As the triplet that maximize the sum {12 , 29 , 0} in order , their sum is (41) ,

Note : duplications are not included when summing , (i.e) the numbers added only once . */

/* Alternate case

Write function alternateCase which switch every letter in string from upper to lower and from lower to upper. E.g: Hello World -> hELLO wORLD */

/* Sort Out The Men From Boys

Scenario
Now that the competition gets tough it will Sort out the men from the boys .

Men are the Even numbers and Boys are the odd!alt!alt
Task
Given an array/list [] of n integers , Separate The even numbers from the odds , or Separate the men from the boys!alt!alt
Notes
Return an array/list where Even numbers come first then odds

Since , Men are stronger than Boys , Then Even numbers in ascending order While odds in descending .

Array/list size is at least 4 .

Array/list numbers could be a mixture of positives , negatives .

Have no fear , It is guaranteed that no Zeroes will exists .!alt
Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur , So (duplications are not included when separating).

Input >> Output Examples:
menFromBoys ({7, 3 , 14 , 17}) ==> return ({14, 17, 7, 3}) 
Explanation:
Since , { 14 } is the even number here , So it came first , then the odds in descending order {17 , 7 , 3} .

menFromBoys ({-94, -99 , -100 , -99 , -96 , -99 }) ==> return ({-100 , -96 , -94 , -99})
Explanation:
Since , { -100, -96 , -94 } is the even numbers here , So it came first in *ascending order *, then the odds in descending order { -99 }

Since , (Duplications are not included when separating) , then you can see only one (-99) was appeared in the final array/list .

menFromBoys ({49 , 818 , -282 , 900 , 928 , 281 , -282 , -1 }) ==> return ({-282 , 818 , 900 , 928 , 281 , 49 , -1})
Explanation:
Since , {-282 , 818 , 900 , 928 } is the even numbers here , So it came first in ascending order , then the odds in descending order { 281 , 49 , -1 }

Since , (Duplications are not included when separating) , then you can see only one (-282) was appeared in the final array/list . */

/* Simple string characters

In this Kata, you will be given a string and your task will be to return a list of ints detailing the count of uppercase letters, lowercase, numbers and special characters, as follows.

--the order is: uppercase letters, lowercase, numbers and special characters. */

/* A Rule of Divisibility by 7

A number m of the form 10x + y is divisible by 7 if and only if x − 2y is divisible by 7. In other words, subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits. Continue to do this until a number known to be divisible by 7 is obtained; you can stop when this number has at most 2 digits because you are supposed to know if a number of at most 2 digits is divisible by 7 or not.

The original number is divisible by 7 if and only if the last number obtained using this procedure is divisible by 7.

Examples:
1 - m = 371 -> 37 − (2×1) -> 37 − 2 = 35 ; thus, since 35 is divisible by 7, 371 is divisible by 7.

The number of steps to get the result is 1.

2 - m = 1603 -> 160 - (2 x 3) -> 154 -> 15 - 8 = 7 and 7 is divisible by 7.

3 - m = 372 -> 37 − (2×2) -> 37 − 4 = 33 ; thus, since 33 is not divisible by 7, 372 is not divisible by 7.

4 - m = 477557101->47755708->4775554->477547->47740->4774->469->28 and 28 is divisible by 7, so is 477557101. The number of steps is 7.

Task:
Your task is to return to the function seven(m) (m integer >= 0) an array (or a pair, depending on the language) of numbers, the first being the last number m with at most 2 digits obtained by your function (this last m will be divisible or not by 7), the second one being the number of steps to get the result.

Forth Note:
Return on the stack number-of-steps, last-number-m-with-at-most-2-digits 

Examples:
seven(371) should return [35, 1]
seven(1603) should return [7, 2]
seven(477557101) should return [28, 7] */

const seven = m => {
  let times = 0
  while (("" + m).length > 2) {
    times++
    m = Math.floor(m / 10) - (m % 10) * 2
  }
  return [m, times]

/* Folding your way to the moon

Have you heard about the myth that if you fold a paper enough times, you can reach the moon with it? Sure you have, but exactly how many? Maybe it's time to write a program to figure it out.

You know that a piece of paper has a thickness of 0.0001m. Given distance in units of meters, calculate how many times you have to fold the paper to make the paper reach this distance.
(If you're not familiar with the concept of folding a paper: Each fold doubles its total thickness.)

Note: Of course you can't do half a fold. You should know what this means ;P

Also, if somebody is giving you a negative distance, it's clearly bogus and you should yell at them by returning null (or whatever equivalent in your language). In Shell please return None. In C and COBOL please return -1. */

In a team meeting, a terrible, awful person declares to the group that you aren't working. You're in trouble. You quickly have to gauge the feeling in the room to decide whether or not you should gather your things and leave.

Given an object (meet) containing team member names as keys, and their happiness rating out of 10 as the value, you need to assess the overall happiness rating of the group. If <= 5, return 'Get Out Now!'. Else return 'Nice Work Champ!'. */

/* Simple consecutive pairs
