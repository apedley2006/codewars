/* Get key/value pairs as arrays

Complete the keysAndValues function so that it takes in an object and returns the keys and values as separate arrays.

Example:

keysAndValues({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}) // should return [['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3]] */

const keysAndValues = data => [Object.keys(data), Object.values(data)];

/* Disemvowel Trolls

Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!". */

function disemvowel(str) {
    return str.replace(/[aeuio]/gi, "")
  }

/* Square Every Digit

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer */

function squareDigits(num){
  return +(num + "").split("").map(value => value * value).join("")
}

/* Highest and Lowest

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

Examples
highAndLow("1 2 3 4 5");  // return "5 1"
highAndLow("1 2 -3 4 5"); // return "5 -3"
highAndLow("1 9 3 4 -5"); // return "9 -5"
Notes
All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
There will always be at least one number in the input string.
Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first. */

function highAndLow(numbers){
  // ...
  
  let nums = numbers.split(" ")
  return `${Math.max(...nums)} ${Math.min(...nums)}`
}
