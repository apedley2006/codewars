/* Get key/value pairs as arrays

Complete the keysAndValues function so that it takes in an object and returns the keys and values as separate arrays.

Example:

keysAndValues({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}) // should return [['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3]] */

const keysAndValues = data => [Object.keys(data), Object.values(data)];

/* Disemvowel Trolls

Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!". */

function disemvowel(str) {
    return str.replace(/[aeuio]/gi, "")
  }

/* Square Every Digit

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer */

function squareDigits(num){
  return +(num + "").split("").map(value => value * value).join("")
}

/* Highest and Lowest

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

Examples
highAndLow("1 2 3 4 5");  // return "5 1"
highAndLow("1 2 -3 4 5"); // return "5 -3"
highAndLow("1 9 3 4 -5"); // return "9 -5"
Notes
All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
There will always be at least one number in the input string.
Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first. */

function highAndLow(numbers){
  // ...
  
  let nums = numbers.split(" ")
  return `${Math.max(...nums)} ${Math.min(...nums)}`
}

/* Descending Order

Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

Examples:
Input: 42145 Output: 54421

Input: 145263 Output: 654321

Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321 */

function descendingOrder(n){
  // have to conver it to a string at first, could also use +n.toString
  
  return +(n + "").split("").sort().reverse().join("")
}

/* Get the Middle Character

You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

#Examples:

Kata.getMiddle("test") should return "es"

Kata.getMiddle("testing") should return "t"

Kata.getMiddle("middle") should return "dd"

Kata.getMiddle("A") should return "A"
#Input

A word (string) of length 0 < str < 1000 (In javascript you may get slightly more than 1000 in some test cases due to an error in the test cases). You do not need to test for this. This is only here to tell you that you do not need to worry about your solution timing out.

#Output

The middle character(s) of the word represented as a string. */

function getMiddle(s) {
  //Code goes here!
  if (s.length % 2 === 0) {
    return s.slice(s.length / 2 - 1, s.length / 2 + 1);
  }
  if (s.length % 2 !== 0) {
    return s.slice(s.length / 2, s.length / 2 + 1);
  }
}

/* Mumbling

This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:

Examples:
accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"
The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z. */

function accum(s) {
	// your code
  return s.split("").map((c, i) => c.toUpperCase() + c.toLowerCase().repeat(i)).join("-")
}

/* List Filtering

In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

Example
filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2]
filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]
filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123] */

function filter_list(l) {
  // Return a new array with the strings filtered out
  return l.filter(i => typeof i == "number")
}

/* Isograms

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

Example: (Input --> Output)

"Dermatoglyphics" --> true "aba" --> false "moOse" --> false (ignore letter case)

isIsogram "Dermatoglyphics" = true
isIsogram "moose" = false
isIsogram "aba" = false */

function isIsogram(str){
  //...
  return !str.match(/([a-z]).*\1/i);
}

/* Exes and Ohs

Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char.

Examples input/output:

XO("ooxx") => true
XO("xooxx") => false
XO("ooxXm") => true
XO("zpzpzpp") => true // when no 'x' and 'o' is present should return true
XO("zzoo") => false */

function XO(str) {
  //code here

let x = str.match(/x/gi)
let o = str.match(/o/gi)
return (x && x.length) === (o && o.length)
}

/* Shortest Word

Simple, given a string of words, return the length of the shortest word(s).

String will never be empty and you do not need to account for different data types. */

function findShort(s) {
  return Math.min(...s.split(" ").map(s => s.length))
}

/* Jaden Casing Strings

Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

Example:

Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real" */

String.prototype.toJadenCase = function () {
  //...
  return this.split(" ").map(w => w[0].toUpperCase() + w.slice(1)).join(" ")
};

/* Complementary DNA

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

More similar exercise are found here: http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/ (source)

Example: (input --> output)

"ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
"GTAT" --> "CATA" */

function DNAStrand(dna){
  //your code here
  const chargaff = {A: 'T', T: 'A', G: 'C', C: 'G'}
  return dna.split('').map(c => chargaff[c]).join('')
}

/* Credit Card Mask

Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct. However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.

Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.

Examples
"4556364607935616" --> "############5616"
     "64607935616" -->      "#######5616"
               "1" -->                "1"
                "" -->                 ""

// "What was the name of your first pet?"

"Skippy" --> "##ippy"

"Nananananananananananananananana Batman!"
-->
"####################################man!" */

// return masked string
function maskify(cc) {
  return cc.slice(0, -4).replace(/\w/g, "#") + cc.slice(-4)
}

/* Sum of two lowest positive integers

Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed.

For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.

[10, 343445353, 3453445, 3453545353453] should return 3453455. */

function sumTwoSmallestNumbers(numbers) {

/* Beginner Series #3 Sum of Numbers

Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!

Examples (a, b) --> output (explanation)
(1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)
(1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)
(0, 1) --> 1 (0 + 1 = 1)
(1, 1) --> 1 (1 since both are same)
(-1, 0) --> -1 (-1 + 0 = -1)
(-1, 2) --> 2 (-1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2) */
