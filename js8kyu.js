material5 and material6 must be selected at the same time
material7 or  material8 must be selected(at least one, or both)
Task
You are given a integer array formula. Array contains only digits 1-8 that represents material 1-8. Your task is to determine if the formula is valid. Returns true if it's valid, false otherwise.

Example
For formula = [1,3,7], The output should be true.

For formula = [7,1,2,3], The output should be false.

For formula = [1,3,5,7], The output should be false.

For formula = [1,5,6,7,3], The output should be true.

For formula = [5,6,7], The output should be true.

For formula = [5,6,7,8], The output should be true.

For formula = [6,7,8], The output should be false.

/* For Twins: 2. Math operations

Task:
A magician in the subway showed you a trick, he put an ice brick in a bottle to impress you. The brick's length and width are equal, forming a square; its height may be different. Just for fun and also to impress the magician and people around, you decided to calculate the brick's volume. Write a function iceBrickVolume that will accept these parameters:

radius - bottle's radius (always > 0);
bottleLength - total bottle length (always > 0);
rimLength - length from bottle top to brick (always < bottleLength);
And return volume of ice brick that magician managed to put into a bottle.

Note:
All inputs are integers. Assume no irregularities to the cuboid brick. You may assume the bottle is shaped like a cylinder. The brick cannot fit inside the rim. The ice brick placed into the bottle is the largest possible cuboid that could actually fit inside the inner volume.

Example 1:

Create a function that finds the integral of the expression passed.

In order to find the integral all you need to do is add one to the exponent (the second argument), and divide the coefficient (the first argument) by that new number.

For example for 3x^2, the integral would be 1x^3: we added 1 to the exponent, and divided the coefficient by that new number).

Notes:

The output should be a string.
The coefficient and exponent is always a positive integer.

As an example, 1080p video with an aspect ratio of 16:9 would have an X resolution of 1920, however 1080p video with an aspect ratio of 4:3 would have an X resolution of 1440.

For example:

derive(7, 8)
In this case, the function should multiply 7 and 8, and then subtract 1 from 8. It should output "56x^7", the first number 56 being the product of the two numbers, and the second number being the exponent minus 1.

derive(7, 8) --> this should output "56x^7" 
derive(5, 9) --> this should output "45x^8"

 Task
Two players - "black" and "white" are playing a game. The game consists of several rounds. If a player wins in a round, he is to move again during the next round. If a player loses a round, it's the other player who moves on the next round. Given whose turn it was on the previous round and whether he won, determine whose turn it is on the next round.

Input/Output
[input] string lastPlayer/$last_player

"black" or "white" - whose move it was during the previous round.

[input] boolean win/$win

true if the player who made a move during the previous round won, false otherwise.

[output] a string

Return "white" if white is to move on the next round, and "black" otherwise.

Example
For lastPlayer = "black" and win = false, the output should be "white".

For lastPlayer = "white" and win = true, the output should be "white". */

function whoseMove(lastPlayer, win) {
  //coding and coding..
  if (lastPlayer === 'white' && win === true){
    return 'white'    
  } else if (lastPlayer === 'white' && win === false){
    return 'black'
  } else if (lastPlayer === 'black' && win === false){
    return 'white'
  } else {
    return 'black'
  }
