/* Find the first non-consecutive number

Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.

By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.

E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.

If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.

The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too! */

function firstNonConsecutive (arr) {
    let results = arr.find((num, index) => num !== index + arr[0])
    return Number.isInteger(results) ? results : null
  }

  /* Duck Duck Goose

  The objective of Duck, duck, goose is to walk in a circle, tapping on each player's head until one is chosen.

Task: Given an array of Player objects (an array of associative arrays in PHP) and an index (1-based), return the name of the chosen Player(name is a property of Player objects, e.g Player.name)

Example:

duck_duck_goose([a, b, c, d], 1) should return a.name
duck_duck_goose([a, b, c, d], 5) should return a.name
duck_duck_goose([a, b, c, d], 4) should return d.name
// PHP only
duck_duck_goose([$a, $b, $c, $d], 1); // => $a["name"]
duck_duck_goose([$a, $b, $c, $d], 5); // => $a["name"]
duck_duck_goose([$a, $b, $c, $d], 4); // => $d["name"] */

function duckDuckGoose(players, goose) {
  // ...
  return players[(goose-1)%players.length].name
}
