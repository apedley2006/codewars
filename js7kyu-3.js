/* Stones on the Table

There are some stones on Bob's table in a row, and each of them can be red, green or blue, indicated by the characters R, G, and B.

Help Bob find the minimum number of stones he needs to remove from the table so that the stones in each pair of adjacent stones have different colours.

Examples:

"RGBRGBRGGB"   => 1
"RGGRGBBRGRR"  => 3
"RRRRGGGGBBBB" => 9 */

function solve(stones) {
    let count = 0
    for (i = 0; i < stones.length; i++){
      if (stones[i] === stones[i+1]){
        count += 1
      }
    } return count
  }

/* Consecutive items

You are given a list of unique integers arr, and two integers a and b. Your task is to find out whether or not a and b appear consecutively in arr, and return a boolean value (True if a and b are consecutive, False otherwise).

It is guaranteed that a and b are both present in arr. */

function consecutive(arr, a, b) {
  // Your code here...
  const indexA = arr.indexOf(a)
  const indexB = arr.indexOf(b)
  return Math.abs(indexA-indexB) === 1
}

/* Generating Markdowns

Your friend has recently started using Codewars to learn more advanced coding. They have just created their first kata, and they want to write a proper description for it, using codeblocks, images and hyperlinks.

However, they are struggling to understand how to use Markdown formatting properly, so they decide to ask for your help, by having you write a program that will generate some of the syntaxes for you.

Markdown syntaxes
links: [displayed text](url address)
images: ![replacement message](url address)
codeblocks: we'll use multiline codeblocks like the following
```language
code
```
Task
Your task is to create a function called generate_markdowns or generateMarkdowns. It will take three parameters:

markdown - The type of markdown to return. It can be "link", "img" or "code".
text - The text,message or code to display
url_or_language or urlOrLanguage - gives either the url address to use or the name of the language for the codeblock.
Examples
generate_markdowns('link','Github Codewars','https://github.com/codewars')
# returns: "[Github Codewars](https://github.com/codewars)" */

function generateMarkdowns(markdown,text,urlOrLanguage) {
  // write your code here
  
  if (markdown === 'img'){
    return `![${text}](${urlOrLanguage})`
  }
  if (markdown === 'link'){
    return `[${text}](${urlOrLanguage})`
  }
  
  return `\`\`\`${urlOrLanguage}\n${text}\n\`\`\``
};

/* Grid index

You are given an n by n ( square ) grid of characters, for example:

[['m', 'y', 'e'], 
 ['x', 'a', 'm'], 
 ['p', 'l', 'e']]
You are also given a list of integers as input, for example:

[1, 3, 5, 8]
You have to find the characters in these indexes of the grid if you think of the indexes as:

[[1, 2, 3], 
 [4, 5, 6], 
 [7, 8, 9]]
Remember that the indexes start from one and not zero.

Then you output a string like this:

"meal"
All inputs will be valid. */

function gridIndex(grid, indices) {
  let str = ""
  grid = "0" + grid.map((v) => v.join``).join``
  indices.map((v) => (str += grid[v]))
  return str
}

/* Right in the Centre

Right in the Center
This is inspired by one of Nick Parlante's exercises on the CodingBat online code practice tool.

Given a sequence of characters, does "abc" appear in the CENTER of the sequence?

The sequence of characters could contain more than one "abc".

To define CENTER, the number of characters in the sequence to the left and right of the "abc" (which is in the middle) must differ by at most one.

If it is in the CENTER, return True. Otherwise, return False.

Write a function as the solution for this problem. This kata looks simple, but it might not be easy.

Example
is_in_middle("AAabcBB")  ->  True
is_in_middle("AabcBB")   ->  True
is_in_middle("AabcBBB")  ->  False */

function isInMiddle(seq) {
  // your goes below 
  return seq.length > 4 ? isInMiddle(seq.slice(1, -1)) : seq.includes('abc')
}

/* Bases Everywhere

Uh oh, Someone at the office has dropped all these sequences on the floor and forgotten to label them with their correct bases.

We have to fix this before the boss gets back or we're all going to be fired!

This is what your years of coding have been leading up to, now is your time to shine!

Task
You will have to create a function which takes in a sequence of numbers in random order and you will have to return the correct base of those numbers.

The base is the number of unique digits. For example, a base 10 number can have 10 unique digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and a base 2 number (Binary) can have 2 unique digits: 0 and 1.

Constraints
The sequence will always be 10 numbers long and we know that the base is going to be between 2 and 10 inclusive so no need to worry about any letters. When sorted, the sequence is made up of consecutive numbers.

Examples
[ "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10" ]     -->  10
[ "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "10", "11", "12", "13" ]  -->   7 */

function baseFinder(seq){
  //Good luck!
  return new Set(seq.join``).size
}
