/* Triangular Treasure

Triangular numbers are so called because of the equilateral triangular shape that they occupy when laid out as dots. i.e.

           *         **
                     *
You need to return the nth triangular number. You should return 0 for out of range values:

For example: (Input --> Output)

0 --> 0
2 --> 3
3 --> 6
-10 --> 0 */

/* Reverse a Number

iven a number, write a function to output its reverse digits. (e.g. given 123 the answer is 321)

Numbers should preserve their sign; i.e. a negative number should still be negative when reversed.

-456 -> -654
1000 ->    1 */

/* Power of two

Complete the function power_of_two/powerOfTwo (or equivalent, depending on your language) that determines if a given non-negative integer is a power of two. From the corresponding Wikipedia entry:

a power of two is a number of the form 2n where n is an integer, i.e. the result of exponentiation with number two as the base and integer n as the exponent.

You may assume the input is always valid.

Examples
isPowerOfTwo(1024) // -> true
isPowerOfTwo(4096) // -> true
isPowerOfTwo(333)  // -> false
Beware of certain edge cases - for example, 1 is a power of 2 since 2^0 = 1 and 0 is not a power of 2. */

Vertical mirror: vert_mirror (or vertMirror or vert-mirror)

Horizontal mirror: hor_mirror (or horMirror or hor-mirror)

ijkl     lkji     |ijkl     efgh 
mnop     ponm     |mnop     abcd 
Task:
Write these two functions
and

high-order function oper(fct, s) where

fct is the function of one variable f to apply to the string s (fct will be one of vertMirror, horMirror)

/* Sort the Gift Code

Happy Holidays fellow Code Warriors!
Santa's senior gift organizer Elf developed a way to represent up to 26 gifts by assigning a unique alphabetical character to each gift. After each gift was assigned a character, the gift organizer Elf then joined the characters to form the gift ordering code.

Santa asked his organizer to order the characters in alphabetical order, but the Elf fell asleep from consuming too much hot chocolate and candy canes! Can you help him out?

Sort the Gift Code
Write a function called sortGiftCode/sort_gift_code/SortGiftCode that accepts a string containing up to 26 unique alphabetical characters, and returns a string containing the same characters in alphabetical order.

Examples (Input -- => Output):
"abcdef"                      -- => "abcdef"
"pqksuvy"                     -- => "kpqsuvy"

Given an array of words, return an array of the number of letters that occupy their positions in the alphabet for each word. For example,

/* Palindrome chain length

Number is a palindrome if it is equal to the number with digits in reversed order. For example, 5, 44, 171, 4884 are palindromes, and 43, 194, 4773 are not.

Write a function which takes a positive integer and returns the number of special steps needed to obtain a palindrome. The special step is: "reverse the digits, and add to the original number". If the resulting number is not a palindrome, repeat the procedure with the sum until the resulting number is a palindrome.

If the input number is already a palindrome, the number of steps is 0.

All inputs are guaranteed to have a final palindrome which does not overflow MAX_SAFE_INTEGER.

Example
For example, start with 87:

  87 +   78 =  165     - step 1, not a palindrome
 165 +  561 =  726     - step 2, not a palindrome
 726 +  627 = 1353     - step 3, not a palindrome
1353 + 3531 = 4884     - step 4, palindrome!
4884 is a palindrome and we needed 4 steps to obtain it, so answer for 87 is 4. */
