That's why they hired you to develop an algorithm and easily calculate the weights of the mountains.
Your function has only one parameter which is the width of the mountain and you need to return the weight of that mountain.

/* Barista problem

You are a barista at a big cafeteria. Normally there are a lot of baristas, but your boss runs a contest and he told you that, if you could handle all the orders with only one coffee machine in such a way that the sum of all the waiting times of the customers is the smallest possible, he will give you a substantial raise.

So you are the only barista today, and you only have one coffee machine that can brew one coffee at a time.
People start giving you their orders.
Let's not think about the time you need to write down their orders, but you need 2 additional minutes to clean the coffee machine after each coffee you make.

Now you have a list coffees of the orders and you write down next to each of the orders the time you need to brew each one of those cups of coffee.

Task:

Given a list of the times you need to brew each coffee, return the minimum total waiting time.
If you get it right, you will get that raise your boss promised you!

Note that:

It is possible to receive no orders. (It's a free day :), maybe the next day your boss will start giving you some orders himself, you probably don't want that :) )

You can only brew one coffee at a time.

Since you have one coffee machine, you have to wait for it to brew the current coffee before you can move on to the next one.

Ignore the time you need to serve the coffee and the time you need to take the orders and write down the time you need to make each one of them.

If you have three customers with times [4,3,2], the first customer is going to wait 4 minutes for his coffee, the second customer is going to wait 4 minutes (the time needed for the first customer to get his coffee), another 2 minutes (the time needed to clean the machine) and 3 more minutes (the time you need to brew his coffee), so in total 9 minutes. The third customer, by the same logic, is about to wait 9 minutes (for the first two customers) + 2 more minutes(cleaning) + 2 minutes (his coffee brewing time). This order of brewing the coffee will end up in a total waiting time of 26 minutes, but note that this may not be the minimum time needed. This time depends on the order you choose to brew the cups of coffee.

The order in which you brew the coffee is totally up to you.

Examples:

coffees = [3,2,5,10,9]  ->  85
coffees = [20,5]        ->  32
coffees = [4,3,2]       ->  22 */

/* Closure Counter

Closure Counter
Define the function counter that returns a function that returns an increasing value.

Example:

Closure:
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

Example:

Notes
The given string will never be empty.

/* I'm everywhere!

Overview
Many people know that Apple uses the letter "i" in almost all of its devices to emphasize its personality.

And so John, a programmer at Apple, was given the task of making a program that would add that letter to every word. Let's help him do it, too.

Task:
Your task is to make a function that takes the value of word and returns it with an "i" at the beginning of the word. For example we get the word "Phone", so we must return "iPhone". But we have a few rules:

The word should not begin with the letter "I", for example Inspire.
The number of vowels should not be greater than or equal to the number of consonants, for example East or Peace. ("y" is considered a consonant)
The first letter should not be lowercase, for example road.
If the word does not meet the rules, we return "Invalid word". */

function i(word) {
  //.. 
  if(!word) return 'Invalid word'
  const fLetter = word.slice(0,1)
  const nVowels = word.slice().split('').filter(v=>/[aioeu]/i.test(v)).length
  if(fLetter === 'I') return 'Invalid word'
  if(fLetter === fLetter.toLowerCase()) return 'Invalid word'
  if(nVowels >= word.length/2) return 'Invalid word'
  return "i"+word
}

/* What a "Classy" Song

A new Song will take two parameters, title and artist.

const mountMoose = new Song('Mount Moose', 'The Snazzy Moose');

mountMoose.title => 'Mount Moose'
mountMoose.artist => 'The Snazzy Moose'
You will also have to create an instance method named howMany() (or how_many()).

The method takes an array of people who have listened to the song that day. The output should be how many new listeners the song gained on that day out of all listeners. Names should be treated in a case-insensitive manner, i.e. "John" is the same as "john".

Example
const mountMoose = new Song('Mount Moose', 'The Snazzy Moose');

// day 1 (or test 1)
mountMoose.howMany(['John', 'Fred', 'BOb', 'carl', 'RyAn']); => 5
// These are all new since they are the first listeners.

// day 2
mountMoose.howMany(['JoHn', 'Luke', 'AmAndA']); => 2
// Luke and Amanda are new, john already listened to it the previous day
Also if the same person listened to it more than once a day it should only count them once.

Example
const mountMoose = new Song('Mount Moose', 'The Snazzy Moose');

// day 1
mountMoose.howMany(['John', 'joHN', 'carl']); => 2

/* Harvest Festival

Four parameters will be given. The four parameters are:

seed (string) - determines the type of flowers generated by the plant.
water (integer) - each unit of water extends the portion of stem between the flowers. It also gives how many times the stems + flower clusters should be repeated
fert (integer) - each unit of fertilizer increases the amount of flowers, grouped in clusters
temp (integer) - if the temperature given is in the range of 20Â°C and 30Â°C, the plant grows normally, otherwise, all the flowers die except for one flower at the end of the stem.
Given the above parameters, your task is to return a string representing the plant.

Examples
plant("@", 3, 3, 25) => "---@@@---@@@---@@@"
# Water gives the length of the stem portions between flowers
# Water also gives the total number of segments(number of times flowers + stems should be repeated)
# Fertilizer gives the length of the flower clusters.
# Temperature is in the range of 20Â°C and 30Â°C

plant("$", 4, 2, 30) => "----$$----$$----$$----$$"

plant("&", 1, 5, 20) => "-&&&&&"

plant("^", 3, 3, 35) => "---------^"
# The temperature is not in the correct range, so all flowers die, except the last one at the end.
# The stem is not affected by the temperature
Notes
Edge conditions will not be tested, meaning parameters of water or fertilizer or temperature being zero. This will not be tested. The parameters will always be valid (no zero).
The temperature bounds are inclusive (20 and 30 will be included as 21, 22, 23, 24...)
