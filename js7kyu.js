The flag is hidden in the string variable MESS

The flag is in the format FLAG{CAPITAL-LETTERS-WITH-HYPHEN}

  /* Odd or Even? Determine that!

  Task
Given a number N, determine if the sum of N consecutive numbers is odd or even.

If the sum is definitely an odd number, return Odd.
If the sum is definitely an even number, return Even.
If the sum can be either odd or even ( depending on which first number you choose ), return Either.
Examples
Odd_or_Even(1) should return Either, because the sum can be odd or even.
Odd_or_Even(6) should return Odd, because 6 consecutive numbers contain 3 odd and 3 even numbers, so their sum is always odd.
Odd_or_Even(8) should return Even, because 8 consecutive numbers contain 4 odd and 4 even numbers, so their sum is always even.

/* Mountains of Hoiyama

In the planet named Hoiyama, scientists are trying to find the weights of the mountains.
They managed to find the weights of some mountains.
But calculating them manually takes a really long time.
That's why they hired you to develop an algorithm and easily calculate the weights of the mountains.
Your function has only one parameter which is the width of the mountain and you need to return the weight of that mountain.
The widths of the mountains are only odd numbers.
They gave you some information about calculating the weight of a mountain.
Examine the information given below and develop a solution accordingly.

/* Barista problem

You are a barista at a big cafeteria. Normally there are a lot of baristas, but your boss runs a contest and he told you that, if you could handle all the orders with only one coffee machine in such a way that the sum of all the waiting times of the customers is the smallest possible, he will give you a substantial raise.

So you are the only barista today, and you only have one coffee machine that can brew one coffee at a time.
People start giving you their orders.
Let's not think about the time you need to write down their orders, but you need 2 additional minutes to clean the coffee machine after each coffee you make.

Now you have a list coffees of the orders and you write down next to each of the orders the time you need to brew each one of those cups of coffee.

Task:

Given a list of the times you need to brew each coffee, return the minimum total waiting time.
If you get it right, you will get that raise your boss promised you!

Note that:

It is possible to receive no orders. (It's a free day :), maybe the next day your boss will start giving you some orders himself, you probably don't want that :) )

You can only brew one coffee at a time.

Since you have one coffee machine, you have to wait for it to brew the current coffee before you can move on to the next one.

Ignore the time you need to serve the coffee and the time you need to take the orders and write down the time you need to make each one of them.

If you have three customers with times [4,3,2], the first customer is going to wait 4 minutes for his coffee, the second customer is going to wait 4 minutes (the time needed for the first customer to get his coffee), another 2 minutes (the time needed to clean the machine) and 3 more minutes (the time you need to brew his coffee), so in total 9 minutes. The third customer, by the same logic, is about to wait 9 minutes (for the first two customers) + 2 more minutes(cleaning) + 2 minutes (his coffee brewing time). This order of brewing the coffee will end up in a total waiting time of 26 minutes, but note that this may not be the minimum time needed. This time depends on the order you choose to brew the cups of coffee.

The order in which you brew the coffee is totally up to you.

Examples:

coffees = [3,2,5,10,9]  ->  85
coffees = [20,5]        ->  32
coffees = [4,3,2]       ->  22 */

  coffees.sort((a,b)=> a-b)
  return coffees.reduce((acc, cookTime, i) => acc + cookTime * (coffees.length-i) + 2*i, 0)
}

/* Boxlines

Boxlines
Given a X*Y*Z box built by arranging 1*1*1 unit boxes, write a function f(X,Y,Z) that returns the number of edges (hence, boxlines) of length 1 (both inside and outside of the box)

Notes
Adjacent unit boxes share the same edges, so a 2*1*1 box will have 20 edges, not 24 edges
X,Y and Z are strictly positive, and can go as large as 2^16 - 1
This is my first kata, so I hope every one will enjoy it <3 */

/* Closure Counter

Closure Counter
Define the function counter that returns a function that returns an increasing value.
The first value should be 1.
You're going to have to use closures.
Example:
const newCounter = counter();
newCounter() // 1
newCounter() // 2
Closure:
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

/* Last Survivor

You are given a string of letters and an array of numbers.
The numbers indicate positions of letters that must be removed, in order, starting from the beginning of the array.
After each removal the size of the string decreases (there is no empty space).

Example:

let str = "zbk", arr = [0, 1]
    str = "bk", arr = [1]
    str = "b", arr = []
    return 'b'
Notes
The given string will never be empty.
The length of the array is always one less than the length of the string.
All numbers are valid.
There can be duplicate letters and numbers. */
