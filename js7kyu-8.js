/* Ordered Count of Characters

Count the number of occurrences of each character and return it as a (list of tuples) in order of appearance. For empty output return (an empty list).

Consult the solution set-up for the exact data structure implementation depending on your language.

Example:

orderedCount("abracadabra") == [['a', 5], ['b', 2], ['r', 2], ['c', 1], ['d', 1]] */

  /* max diff - easy

  You must implement a function that returns the difference between the largest and the smallest value in a given list / array (lst) received as the parameter.

lst contains integers, that means it may contain some negative numbers
if lst is empty or contains a single element, return 0
lst is not sorted

[1, 2, 3, -4]  //  returns 7 because 3 - (-4) == 7 */

/* Boiled Eggs

You are the greatest chef on earth. No one boils eggs like you! Your restaurant is always full of guests, who love your boiled eggs. But when there is a greater order of boiled eggs, you need some time, because you have only one pot for your job. How much time do you need?

Your Task
Implement a function, which takes a non-negative integer, representing the number of eggs to boil. It must return the time in minutes (integer), which it takes to have all the eggs boiled.

Rules
you can put at most 8 eggs into the pot at once
it takes 5 minutes to boil an egg
we assume, that the water is boiling all the time (no time to heat up)
for simplicity we also don't consider the time it takes to put eggs into the pot or get them out of it
Example (Input --> Output)
0 --> 0
5 --> 5
10 --> 10 */

  An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number that was deleted.

Example:

The starting array sequence is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
The mixed array with one deleted number is [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]
Your function should return the int 5.
If no number was deleted from the starting array, your function should return the int 0.

Note: N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be []). */

/* Leap Years

In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

years divisible by 4 are leap years
but years divisible by 100 are not leap years
but years divisible by 400 are leap years
Additional Notes:

Only valid years (positive integers) will be tested, so you don't have to validate them
Examples can be found in the test fixture. */

remove the 4 at index 1
remove the 3 at index 3
Expected output: [4, 6, 3] */

/* Find the nth Digit of a Number

Complete the function that takes two numbers as input, num and nth and return the nth digit of num (counting from right to left).

Note
If num is negative, ignore its sign and treat it as a positive value
If nth is not positive, return -1
Keep in mind that 42 = 00042. This means that findDigit(42, 5) would return 0

-2825, 3 --> 8
-456, 4 --> 0
0, 20 --> 0

/* Gauß needs help! (Sums of a lot of numbers).

Due to another of his misbehaved, the primary school's teacher of the young Gauß, Herr J.G. Büttner, to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time, while he teaching arithmetic to his mates, assigned him the problem of adding up all the whole numbers from 1 through a given number n.

Your task is to help the young Carl Friedrich to solve this problem as quickly as you can; so, he can astonish his teacher and rescue his recreation interval.

Here's, an example:

f(n=100) // returns 5050 
It's your duty to verify that n is a valid positive integer number. If not, please, return false (None for Python, null for C#, 0 for COBOL). */

/* Sum of array singles

In this Kata, you will be given an array of numbers in which two numbers occur once and the rest occur only twice. Your task will be to return the sum of the numbers that occur only once.

For example, repeats([4,5,7,5,4,8]) = 15 because only the numbers 7 and 8 occur once, and their sum is 15. Every other number occurs twice.

More examples in the test cases. */
