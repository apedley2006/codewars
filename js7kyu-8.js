/* Ordered Count of Characters

Count the number of occurrences of each character and return it as a (list of tuples) in order of appearance. For empty output return (an empty list).

Consult the solution set-up for the exact data structure implementation depending on your language.

Example:

orderedCount("abracadabra") == [['a', 5], ['b', 2], ['r', 2], ['c', 1], ['d', 1]] */

const orderedCount = s =>
  Array.from(s.split('').reduce((m, k) => m.set(k, m.has(k) ? m.get(k) + 1 : 1), new Map()));

  /* max diff - easy

  You must implement a function that returns the difference between the largest and the smallest value in a given list / array (lst) received as the parameter.

lst contains integers, that means it may contain some negative numbers
if lst is empty or contains a single element, return 0
lst is not sorted
[1, 2, 3, 4]   //  returns 3 because 4 -   1  == 3
[1, 2, 3, -4]  //  returns 7 because 3 - (-4) == 7 */

function maxDiff(list) {
  if (!list.length) return 0
  return Math.max(...list) - Math.min(...list)
}
