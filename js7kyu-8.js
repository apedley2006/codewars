/* Ordered Count of Characters

Count the number of occurrences of each character and return it as a (list of tuples) in order of appearance. For empty output return (an empty list).

Consult the solution set-up for the exact data structure implementation depending on your language.

Example:

orderedCount("abracadabra") == [['a', 5], ['b', 2], ['r', 2], ['c', 1], ['d', 1]] */

const orderedCount = s =>
  Array.from(s.split('').reduce((m, k) => m.set(k, m.has(k) ? m.get(k) + 1 : 1), new Map()));

  /* max diff - easy

  You must implement a function that returns the difference between the largest and the smallest value in a given list / array (lst) received as the parameter.

lst contains integers, that means it may contain some negative numbers
if lst is empty or contains a single element, return 0
lst is not sorted
[1, 2, 3, 4]   //  returns 3 because 4 -   1  == 3
[1, 2, 3, -4]  //  returns 7 because 3 - (-4) == 7 */

function maxDiff(list) {
  if (!list.length) return 0
  return Math.max(...list) - Math.min(...list)
}

/* Simple beads count

/* Boiled Eggs

You are the greatest chef on earth. No one boils eggs like you! Your restaurant is always full of guests, who love your boiled eggs. But when there is a greater order of boiled eggs, you need some time, because you have only one pot for your job. How much time do you need?

Your Task
Implement a function, which takes a non-negative integer, representing the number of eggs to boil. It must return the time in minutes (integer), which it takes to have all the eggs boiled.

Rules
you can put at most 8 eggs into the pot at once
it takes 5 minutes to boil an egg
we assume, that the water is boiling all the time (no time to heat up)
for simplicity we also don't consider the time it takes to put eggs into the pot or get them out of it
Example (Input --> Output)
0 --> 0
5 --> 5
10 --> 10 */

function cookingTime(eggs) {
  // TODO
  return 5 * Math.ceil(eggs / 8)

/* Sum of Odd Cubed Numbers

Find the sum of the odd numbers within an array, after cubing the initial integers. The function should return undefined if any of the values aren't numbers. */

  const areNumbers = arr.every(element => typeof element === "number");

      .filter(number => number % 2 !== 0)
      .reduce((total, value) => total + value, 0);
  }

  /* Lost number in number sequence

  An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number that was deleted.

Example:

The starting array sequence is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
The mixed array with one deleted number is [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]
Your function should return the int 5.
If no number was deleted from the starting array, your function should return the int 0.

Note: N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be []). */

function findDeletedNumber(arr, mixArr) {
  // your code
  return arr.find(number => !mixArr.includes(number)) || 0

/* Leap Years

In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

years divisible by 4 are leap years
but years divisible by 100 are not leap years
but years divisible by 400 are leap years
Additional Notes:

Only valid years (positive integers) will be tested, so you don't have to validate them
Examples can be found in the test fixture. */

  // TODO
  return (year % 100 !== 0 && year % 4 === 0) || year % 400 === 0
