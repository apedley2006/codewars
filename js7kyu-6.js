/* Fix string case

In this Kata, you will be given a string that may have mixed uppercase and lowercase letters and your task is to convert that string to either lowercase only or uppercase only based on:

make as few changes as possible.
if the string contains equal number of uppercase and lowercase letters, convert the string to lowercase.
For example:

solve("coDe") = "code". Lowercase characters > uppercase. Change only the "D" to lowercase.
solve("CODe") = "CODE". Uppercase characters > lowecase. Change only the "e" to uppercase.
solve("coDE") = "code". Upper == lowercase. Change all to lowercase. */

function solve(s){
    //..
  let up = s.split("").filter(v => v.match(/[A-Z]/)).length
  let down = s.split("").filter(v => v.match(/[a-z]/)).length
  return down >= up ? s.toLowerCase() : s.toUpperCase()
}

/* Largest 5 digit number in a series

In the following 6 digit number:

283910
91 is the greatest sequence of 2 consecutive digits.

In the following 10 digit number:

1234567890
67890 is the greatest sequence of 5 consecutive digits.

Complete the solution so that it returns the greatest sequence of five consecutive digits found within the number given. The number will be passed in as a string of only digits. It should return a five digit integer. The number passed may be as large as 1000 digits. */

function solution(digits){
  let answer = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < digits.length; i++) {
    let number = digits.substr(i, 5) //each loop iteration pulls the next 5 digits into a substring
    if (Number(number) > answer) {
      //convert to number and compare against answer
      answer = Number(number)
    }
  }
  return answer
}

/* Alternate capitalization

Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be considered even.

For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test cases for more examples.

The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces. */

function capitalize(s){
  return [s.split('').map((v,i)=>i%2==0?v.toUpperCase():v.toLowerCase()).join(''),
          s.split('').map((v,i)=>i%2!==0?v.toUpperCase():v.toLowerCase()).join('')];
}

/* The Coupon Code

Story
Your online store likes to give out coupons for special occasions. Some customers try to cheat the system by entering invalid codes or using expired coupons.

Task
Your mission:
Write a function called checkCoupon which verifies that a coupon code is valid and not expired.

A coupon is no more valid on the day AFTER the expiration date. All dates will be passed as strings in this format: "MONTH DATE, YEAR".

Examples:
checkCoupon("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 9, 2015")  ===  true
checkCoupon("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 2, 2015")  ===  false */

function checkCoupon(enteredCode, correctCode, currentDate, expirationDate){
  return (
    enteredCode === correctCode &&
    Date.parse(expirationDate) >= Date.parse(currentDate)
  )
}

/* Flatten and sort an array

Challenge:

Given a two-dimensional array of integers, return the flattened version of the array with all the integers in the sorted (ascending) order.

Example:

Given [[3, 2, 1], [4, 6, 5], [], [9, 7, 8]], your function should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. */

"use strict";

function flattenAndSort(array) {
  // Good luck, brave code warrior!
  return [].concat(...array).sort((a, b) => a - b)
}

/* Row Weights

Scenario
Several people are standing in a row divided into two teams.
The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1, and so on.

Task
Given an array of positive integers (the weights of the people), return a new array/tuple of two integers, where the first one is the total weight of team 1, and the second one is the total weight of team 2.

Notes
Array size is at least 1.
All numbers will be positive.
Input >> Output Examples
rowWeights([13, 27, 49])  ==>  return (62, 27)
Explanation:
The first element 62 is the total weight of team 1, and the second element 27 is the total weight of team 2.

rowWeights([50, 60, 70, 80])  ==>  return (120, 140)
Explanation:
The first element 120 is the total weight of team 1, and the second element 140 is the total weight of team 2.

rowWeights([80])  ==>  return (80, 0)
Explanation:
The first element 80 is the total weight of team 1, and the second element 0 is the total weight of team 2. */

function rowWeights(array){
  //your code here
  
  return array.reduce((a, b, i) => ((a[i % 2] += b), a), [0, 0])
}

/* Maximum Length Difference

You are given two arrays a1 and a2 of strings. Each string is composed with letters from a to z. Let x be any string in the first array and y be any string in the second array.

Find max(abs(length(x) âˆ’ length(y)))

If a1 and/or a2 are empty return -1 in each language except in Haskell (F#) where you will return Nothing (None).

Example:
a1 = ["hoqq", "bbllkw", "oox", "ejjuyyy", "plmiis", "xxxzgpsssa", "xxwwkktt", "znnnnfqknaz", "qqquuhii", "dvvvwz"]
a2 = ["cccooommaaqqoxii", "gggqaffhhh", "tttoowwwmmww"]
mxdiflg(a1, a2) --> 13 */

function mxdiflg(a1, a2) {
  // your code
  if (a1.length === 0 || a2.length === 0) return -1
  let l1 = a1.map(str => str.length)
  let l2 = a2.map(str => str.length)
  return Math.max(Math.max(...l1) - Math.min(...l2), Math.max(...l2) - Math.min(...l1))
}

/* Remove duplicate words

Your task is to remove all duplicate words from a string, leaving only single (first) words entries.

Example:

Input:

'alpha beta beta gamma gamma gamma delta alpha beta beta gamma gamma gamma delta'

Output:

'alpha beta gamma delta' */

function removeDuplicateWords (s) {
  // your perfect code...
  return [...new Set(s.split(" "))].join(" ")
}

/* JavaScript Array Filter

JavaScript Arrays support a filter function (starting in JavaScript 1.6). Use the filter functionality to complete the function given.

The solution would work like the following:

getEvenNumbers([2,4,5,6]) // should == [2,4,6] */

function getEvenNumbers(numbersArray){
  // filter out the odd numbers
  return numbersArray.filter(value => {
    if (value % 2 == 0) return value;
  });
}

/* Coding Meetup #1 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Count the number of JavaScript developers coming from Europe

You will be given an array of objects (hashes in ruby) representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the coding meetup that you are organising for the first time.

Your task is to return the number of JavaScript developers coming from Europe.

For example, given the following list:

var list1 = [
  { firstName: 'Noah', lastName: 'M.', country: 'Switzerland', continent: 'Europe', age: 19, language: 'JavaScript' },
  { firstName: 'Maia', lastName: 'S.', country: 'Tahiti', continent: 'Oceania', age: 28, language: 'JavaScript' },
  { firstName: 'Shufen', lastName: 'L.', country: 'Taiwan', continent: 'Asia', age: 35, language: 'HTML' },
  { firstName: 'Sumayah', lastName: 'M.', country: 'Tajikistan', continent: 'Asia', age: 30, language: 'CSS' }
];
your function should return number 1.

If, there are no JavaScript developers from Europe then your function should return 0.

Notes:

The format of the strings will always be Europe and JavaScript.
All data will always be valid and uniform as in the example above.

This kata is part of the Coding Meetup series which includes a number of short and easy to follow katas which have been designed to allow mastering the use of higher-order functions. In JavaScript this includes methods like: forEach, filter, map, reduce, some, every, find, findIndex. Other approaches to solving the katas are of course possible. */

function countDevelopers(list) {
  // your awesome code here :)
  
  return list.filter(x => x.continent == "Europe" && x.language == "JavaScript").length
}

/* Sum of angles
