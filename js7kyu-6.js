/* Fix string case

In this Kata, you will be given a string that may have mixed uppercase and lowercase letters and your task is to convert that string to either lowercase only or uppercase only based on:

make as few changes as possible.
if the string contains equal number of uppercase and lowercase letters, convert the string to lowercase.
For example:

solve("coDe") = "code". Lowercase characters > uppercase. Change only the "D" to lowercase.
solve("CODe") = "CODE". Uppercase characters > lowecase. Change only the "e" to uppercase.
solve("coDE") = "code". Upper == lowercase. Change all to lowercase. */

function solve(s){
    //..
  let up = s.split("").filter(v => v.match(/[A-Z]/)).length
  let down = s.split("").filter(v => v.match(/[a-z]/)).length
  return down >= up ? s.toLowerCase() : s.toUpperCase()
}

/* Largest 5 digit number in a series

In the following 6 digit number:

283910
91 is the greatest sequence of 2 consecutive digits.

In the following 10 digit number:

1234567890
67890 is the greatest sequence of 5 consecutive digits.

Complete the solution so that it returns the greatest sequence of five consecutive digits found within the number given. The number will be passed in as a string of only digits. It should return a five digit integer. The number passed may be as large as 1000 digits. */

function solution(digits){
  let answer = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < digits.length; i++) {
    let number = digits.substr(i, 5) //each loop iteration pulls the next 5 digits into a substring
    if (Number(number) > answer) {
      //convert to number and compare against answer
      answer = Number(number)
    }
  }
  return answer
}

/* Alternate capitalization

Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be considered even.

For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test cases for more examples.

The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces. */

function capitalize(s){
  return [s.split('').map((v,i)=>i%2==0?v.toUpperCase():v.toLowerCase()).join(''),
          s.split('').map((v,i)=>i%2!==0?v.toUpperCase():v.toLowerCase()).join('')];
}

/* The Coupon Code

Story
Your online store likes to give out coupons for special occasions. Some customers try to cheat the system by entering invalid codes or using expired coupons.

Task
Your mission:
Write a function called checkCoupon which verifies that a coupon code is valid and not expired.

A coupon is no more valid on the day AFTER the expiration date. All dates will be passed as strings in this format: "MONTH DATE, YEAR".

Examples:
checkCoupon("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 9, 2015")  ===  true
checkCoupon("123", "123", "July 9, 2015", "July 2, 2015")  ===  false */

function checkCoupon(enteredCode, correctCode, currentDate, expirationDate){
  return (
    enteredCode === correctCode &&
    Date.parse(expirationDate) >= Date.parse(currentDate)
  )
}

/* Flatten and sort an array

Challenge:

Given a two-dimensional array of integers, return the flattened version of the array with all the integers in the sorted (ascending) order.

Example:

Given [[3, 2, 1], [4, 6, 5], [], [9, 7, 8]], your function should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. */

"use strict";

function flattenAndSort(array) {
  // Good luck, brave code warrior!
  return [].concat(...array).sort((a, b) => a - b)
}

/* Row Weights

Scenario
Several people are standing in a row divided into two teams.
The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1, and so on.

Task
Given an array of positive integers (the weights of the people), return a new array/tuple of two integers, where the first one is the total weight of team 1, and the second one is the total weight of team 2.

Notes
Array size is at least 1.
All numbers will be positive.
Input >> Output Examples
rowWeights([13, 27, 49])  ==>  return (62, 27)
Explanation:
The first element 62 is the total weight of team 1, and the second element 27 is the total weight of team 2.

rowWeights([50, 60, 70, 80])  ==>  return (120, 140)
Explanation:
The first element 120 is the total weight of team 1, and the second element 140 is the total weight of team 2.

rowWeights([80])  ==>  return (80, 0)
Explanation:
The first element 80 is the total weight of team 1, and the second element 0 is the total weight of team 2. */

function rowWeights(array){
  //your code here
  
  return array.reduce((a, b, i) => ((a[i % 2] += b), a), [0, 0])
}

/* Maximum Length Difference

You are given two arrays a1 and a2 of strings. Each string is composed with letters from a to z. Let x be any string in the first array and y be any string in the second array.

Find max(abs(length(x) âˆ’ length(y)))

If a1 and/or a2 are empty return -1 in each language except in Haskell (F#) where you will return Nothing (None).

Example:
a1 = ["hoqq", "bbllkw", "oox", "ejjuyyy", "plmiis", "xxxzgpsssa", "xxwwkktt", "znnnnfqknaz", "qqquuhii", "dvvvwz"]
a2 = ["cccooommaaqqoxii", "gggqaffhhh", "tttoowwwmmww"]
mxdiflg(a1, a2) --> 13 */

function mxdiflg(a1, a2) {
  // your code
  if (a1.length === 0 || a2.length === 0) return -1
  let l1 = a1.map(str => str.length)
  let l2 = a2.map(str => str.length)
  return Math.max(Math.max(...l1) - Math.min(...l2), Math.max(...l2) - Math.min(...l1))
}
