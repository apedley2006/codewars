/* Who is going to pay for the wall?

Don Drumphet lives in a nice neighborhood, but one of his neighbors has started to let his house go. Don Drumphet wants to build a wall between his house and his neighbor’s, and is trying to get the neighborhood association to pay for it. He begins to solicit his neighbors to petition to get the association to build the wall. Unfortunately for Don Drumphet, he cannot read very well, has a very limited attention span, and can only remember two letters from each of his neighbors’ names. As he collects signatures, he insists that his neighbors keep truncating their names until two letters remain, and he can finally read them.

Your code will show Full name of the neighbor and the truncated version of the name as an array. If the number of the characters in name is less than or equal to two, it will return an array containing only the name as is" */

/* ES6 string addition

It is easy to join two strings together like this string1 + string2.

Another way to get the desired result would be with string1.concat(string2)

ES6 has introduced another way of joining strings. Your task is to find out what this is and write a function that will add two strings together, there must be a space between the two strings.

+ , .concat() & .join() will not be allowed in this exercise. I have also removed some other methods that can be used to cheat!

If one of the arguments is a number your code must coerce it into being a string. */

/* Alan Partridge II - Apple Turnover

Backstory

As a treat, I'll let you read part of the script from a classic 'I'm Alan Partridge episode:

Lynn: Alan, there’s that teacher chap.
Alan: Michael, if he hits me, will you hit him first?
Michael: No, he’s a customer. I cannot hit customers. I’ve been told. I’ll go and get some stock.
Alan: Yeah, chicken stock.
Phil: Hello Alan.
Alan: Lynn, hand me an apple pie. And remove yourself from the theatre of conflict.
Lynn: What do you mean?
Alan: Go and stand by the yakults. The temperature inside this apple turnover is 1,000 degrees. If I squeeze it, a jet of molten Bramley apple is going to squirt out. Could go your way, could go mine. Either way, one of us is going down.
Alan is known for referring to the temperature of the apple turnover as Hotter than the sun!. According to space.com the temperature of the sun's corona is 2,000,000 degrees Celsius, but we will ignore the science for now.

Task
Your job is simple, if x squared is more than 1000, return It's hotter than the sun!!, else, return Help yourself to a honeycomb Yorkie for the glovebox.

Note: Input will either be a positive integer (or a string for untyped languages). */

function apple(x){
  if (x**2 > 1000){
    return "It's hotter than the sun!!"

    return "Help yourself to a honeycomb Yorkie for the glovebox."

}

/* Simple Comparison?

Write a function that will compare two values, one will be a number and one will be a string. Return true if they are the same character (regardless of their different data types) and return false if they are not.

To make this challange harder and to promp the challenger to read up about coercion I have disabled some of the built in methods including .toString(), .join(), .split(), parseInt and .Number(). */

function add(a, b){
	// code here
  return +a == +b
}

/* Well of Ideas - Easy Version

The wide-mouth frog is particularly interested in the eating habits of other creatures.

He just can't stop asking the creatures he encounters what they like to eat. But, then he meets the alligator who just LOVES to eat wide-mouthed frogs!

When he meets the alligator, it then makes a tiny mouth.

/* Holiday VI - Shark Pontoon

Your friend invites you out to a cool floating pontoon around 1km off the beach. Among other things, the pontoon has a huge slide that drops you out right into the ocean, a small way from a set of stairs used to climb out.

As you plunge out of the slide into the water, you see a shark hovering in the darkness under the pontoon... Crap!

You need to work out if the shark will get to you before you can get to the pontoon. To make it easier... as you do the mental calculations in the water you either freeze when you realise you are dead, or swim when you realise you can make it!

You are given 5 variables;

sharkDistance = distance from the shark to the pontoon. The shark will eat you if it reaches you before you escape to the pontoon.

sharkSpeed = how fast it can move in metres/second.

pontoonDistance = how far you need to swim to safety in metres.

youSpeed = how fast you can swim in metres/second.

dolphin = a boolean, if true, you can half the swimming speed of the shark as the dolphin will attack it.

The pontoon, you, and the shark are all aligned in one dimension.

If you make it, return "Alive!", if not, return "Shark Bait!". */

/* String cleaning

Your boss decided to save money by purchasing some cut-rate optical character recognition software for scanning in the text of old novels to your database. At first it seems to capture words okay, but you quickly notice that it throws in a lot of numbers at random places in the text.

Examples (input -> output)
'! !'                 -> '! !'
'123456789'           -> ''
'This looks5 grea8t!' -> 'This looks great!'
Your harried co-workers are looking to you for a solution to take this garbled text and remove all of the numbers. Your program will take in a string and clean out all numeric characters, and return a string with spacing and special characters ~#$%^&!@*():;"'.,? all intact. */

function stringClean(s){
  // Function will return the cleaned string
  return s.replace(/\d/g, "")

/* Reversing Words in a String

You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string. A word can also fit an empty string. If this is not clear enough, here are some examples:

As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.

Example (Input --> Output)

"Hello World" --> "World Hello"
"Hi There." --> "There. Hi" */

function reverse(string){
  //your code here
  return string.split(" ").reverse().join(" ")
}

/* Get number from string

Write a function which removes from string all non-digit characters and parse the remaining to number. E.g: "hell5o wor6ld" -> 56

Function:

getNumberFromString(s) */

function getNumberFromString(s) {
  return Number(s.match(/\d/g).join(''))
}

/* String repeat

Write a function that accepts an integer n and a string s as parameters, and returns a string of s repeated exactly n times.

Examples (input -> output)
6, "I"     -> "IIIIII"
5, "Hello" -> "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello" */

function repeatStr (n, s) {
  return s.repeat(n)
}

/* MakeUpperCase

Write a function which converts the input string to uppercase. */

function makeUpperCase(str) {
  // Code here

/* Crash Override

Every budding hacker needs an alias! The Phantom Phreak, Acid Burn, Zero Cool and Crash Override are some notable examples from the film Hackers.

Your task is to create a function that, given a proper first and last name, will return the correct alias.

Notes:
Two objects that return a one word name in response to the first letter of the first name and one for the first letter of the surname are already given.

If the first character of either of the names given to the function is not a letter from A - Z, you should return "Your name must start with a letter from A - Z."

Sometimes people might forget to capitalize the first letter of their name so your function should accommodate for these grammatical errors.

Examples
var firstName = {A: 'Alpha', B: 'Beta', C: 'Cache' ...}
var surname = {A: 'Analogue', B: 'Bomb', C: 'Catalyst' ...}

aliasGen('Larry', 'Brentwood') === 'Logic Bomb'
aliasGen('123abc', 'Petrovic') === 'Your name must start with a letter from A - Z.'
Happy hacking! */

const firstLetter = str => str[0].toUpperCase()

const isValidName = name => /[a-z]/gi.test(name)

const aliasGen = (fName, sName) =>
  isValidName(fName[0]) && isValidName(sName[0])
    ? `${firstName[firstLetter(fName)]} ${surname[firstLetter(sName)]}`
    : 'Your name must start with a letter from A - Z.'

/* Count words

Can you implement a function that will return number of words in a string?

You have to ensure that spaces in string is a whitespace for real.

Let's take a look on some examples:

countWords("Hello"); // returns 1 as int
countWords("Hello, World!") // returns 2
countWords("No results for search term `s`") // returns 6
countWords(" Hello") // returns 1
// ... and so on
What kind of tests we made for your code:

Function have to count words and not spaces. You have to be sure that you doing it right
Empty string has no words.
String with spaces around should be trimmed.
Non-whitespace (ex. breakspace, unicode chars) should be treated as a delimiter
Doublecheck that words with chars like -, ', ` are counted right. */

function countWords(str) {
  // ...
  return str.split(/\s/).filter(ele => ele).length
}
